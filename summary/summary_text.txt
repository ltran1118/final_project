Police killings have affected many individuals in the United States, and with rises in accusations of police brutality in recent years, our group decided to explore the data and trends regarding these sensitive events. 

The dataset we are working with contains details of police killings in the United States. The data is available from 2013 through 2016. The data is from mappingpoliceviolence.org, and as per their wesbite, “Mapping Police Violence is a research collaborative collecting comprehensive data on police killings nationwide to quantify the impact of police violence in communities.” Their team includes a data scientist, activists, journalists, and teachers.
